# SpaceX has done it again

## Go green, save a life!

Hey, thanks for the opportunity to take this test.

I have been driving a Tesla Model S for 7 years, yeey! Planted a few trees and watched everything there is to watch about SpaceX, astronomy and how big our universe is.

Given more time and resources, I'm sure I'd work on a project that WoW's clients and users.

I've attached a bit of flavour, a bit of spice, something of my own.

The project has a custom icon, and is a little bit prepared for SEO considerations.

I've used a feature based approach where responsibility is split in files related to a component, all near each other.

## Ag-grid

To sort and search as required, I've used the sorting provided by ag-grid-react, and the search as well.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
